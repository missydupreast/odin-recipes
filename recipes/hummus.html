   <h3>The most delicious hummus ever!</h3>
   <p>This creamy, garlicky hummus can't be beat. What's the trick to getting silky, smooth hummus?
    It's all in the order that you blend your ingredients. Many hummus recipes will tell you to toss 
    all of the ingredients in the food processor at once, but I find that this leads to coarse, and 
    sometimes lumpy hummus. For the best texture, follow the steps below.
